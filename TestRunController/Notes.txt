TestRun Agent is on each test machine
Makes calls to TestRun Controller for the next test to run
TestRun Contoller sends each agent the test to run, and a test run Id.
	Agents need to return the test result and the test run id (in an e-tag) so that we can link test runs with results
	Aborted test runs will simply discard any existing test results
To get the test run results, look up the trx file for the completed test run.
